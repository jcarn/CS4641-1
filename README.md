# CS 4641 Assignments

This repository contains all of the work that I did for the Machine Learning class at Georgia Tech CS4641.

### Assignment 1: Supervised Learning

This project contains some experiments with supervised learning, with Sklearn implementations for Decision Trees, NN, Boosting, SVMs and kNNs.

### Assignment 2: Randomized Optimization

This project used ABAGAIL to implement four local random search algorithms: Randomized hill climbing, Simulated Annealing, genetic algorithms, and MIMIC

### Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning and Feature Reduction

Implemented K Means, Expectation Maximization, PCA, ICA, Randomized Projection and Randomized Subsets

### Assignment 4: Markov Decision Processes

Used some boiler plate code from [Juan Jose's MDP code](https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4)
