# README

To run the code, you will need ABAGAIL. Link the ABAGAIL .jar file to each of the four files included in this repository, either through IntelliJ, or through some command line arguments. The output of the code will be written out through the standard output. 

For Part 2, I have also included a utility to parse this user readable output into a CSV in the Python3 file `parse.py`. Upon running the script with `python parse.py`, it will prompy you for three things: the name of the input file to be parsed into a CSV, a name for the output file, and how many recordings were made for each optimizer. This parser will not work with the output from Part 1.

Please note that I changed the format of the output halfway through this assignment, so the parser will work on new output, but not the output that I have turned in with this paper.
